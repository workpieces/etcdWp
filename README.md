Etcd (pronounced et-see-dee) is an open source distributed unified key-value store for shared configuration, service discovery, and scheduling coordination of distributed systems or clusters of computers. Etcd helps facilitate more secure automatic updates, coordinates scheduling to hosts, and helps set up the container's overlay network.

Etcd is a core component of many other projects. Most notably, it is the primary data store for Kubernetes and the de facto standard system for container orchestration. Using ETCD, cloud native applications can maintain more consistent uptime and function in the event of individual server failures. The application reads data from etCD and writes to it; Distributed configuration data provides redundancy and flexibility for node configuration.
